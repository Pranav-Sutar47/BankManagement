A Bank Management System developed using JavaFX and MySQL typically serves as a desktop application for managing various operations related to a bank. This project integrates a graphical user interface (GUI) with the backend database system (MySQL) to handle customer data, transactions, accounts, and other banking-related functionalities.

Here’s a detailed overview of the key components and features of such a system:

1. Core Components
JavaFX (Frontend/GUI): JavaFX is used to build a user-friendly interface for the application. It provides various graphical elements like buttons, text fields, tables, and forms for interaction.
MySQL (Backend/Database): MySQL is used for storing and managing all the data related to customers, accounts, and transactions. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is typically used to connect JavaFX with the MySQL database.


2. Features
A bank management system built using JavaFX and MySQL might include the following features:

A. Account Management
Create New Accounts: Allows users (bank staff/admin) to create new bank accounts for customers. The required data like name, address, ID proof, and initial deposit can be captured via a form.
View Account Details: A table or form displaying the account information such as balance, transaction history, account holder details, and other relevant information.
Delete Accounts: The ability to close or delete a customer’s account from the system.
B. Customer Management
Customer Registration: Input details for new customers such as name, contact information, address, and account type.
Customer Information Update: Update customer records as needed (e.g., change of address, contact number).
Customer Lookup: Search functionality to find customer records based on criteria like name, account number, etc.
C. Transaction Management
Deposit and Withdrawals: Allow bank staff or customers to deposit money or withdraw funds from their accounts.
Fund Transfers: Implement a feature to transfer money between accounts. The transfer includes selecting source and destination accounts, the amount, and authentication steps.
Transaction History: View and export transaction history for any account over a specified period.
D. Authentication & Authorization
Login System: Implement secure login functionality for different users like Admins, Bank Staff, and Customers.
Role-based Access Control: Ensure that only authorized users have access to certain features (e.g., admins can delete accounts, but bank staff cannot).
E. Reports Generation
Account Statements: Generate and download statements for customer accounts.
Transaction Reports: Generate reports for transactions within a specified date range.
Customer Reports: Provide detailed reports on customer activity.


3. Project Structure
The typical structure of the JavaFX project would look something like this:

Frontend (JavaFX): FXML files for layouts and controllers for handling user input.
Database (MySQL): Tables such as Customers, Accounts, Transactions, Loans, etc.
Data Access Layer (DAO): Classes responsible for querying and interacting with the database.
Model Classes: Classes representing entities like Customer, Account, Transaction, etc.
Service Layer: Business logic to handle operations like fund transfers, loan applications, etc.
Util Classes: Helper classes for managing JDBC connections, input validations, and other utility functions.
